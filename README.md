# Arcade_Documentation
- Documentation for the arcade machine that I did on 2015. 
- The core is a RaspberryPi V2 with a retropie image installed. 
- I used many different tutorials all over the internet to do it. One specific and important tutorial is Adafruit's one for the emulation of a keyboard when connecting  RPi's GPIO to ground.
- The designed was made by me, inspired in many designs over the internet
